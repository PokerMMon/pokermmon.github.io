# POKÉMON HORIZONS: THE SERIES Episode List
This is a website to easily access Pokémon Horizons episodes in Japanese, Subbed and Dubbed in English!
<br>This repository does not include every current episode, but is instead uploaded on an alternative site.
<br>Episodes were obtained from https://huggingface.co/PokerMon/PokemonHorizons and uploaded to a file sharing service.
## Features
- Japanese episodes from the PokemonCoJP YouTube channel (OR TV Tokyo)
- English Subbed episodes from a random website I found
- English Dubbed episodes from BBC iPlayer (currently, dunno about Netflix)
## How to Use
### Messaging Services
If you want to embed these episodes in messaging services, you can link this website (https://pokermmon.github.io) then afterwards, enter a slash, then specify if its jp, en_s, or en_d, then another slash and the episode number. Once sent, this will embed a video link to the video with the thumbnail (if both are available).

If you go to the main website, you will see an episode list with the episode number, episode name (in JP/EN), and the JP, Subbed, and Dubbed versions will be available on the side.
