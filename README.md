# POKÉMON HORIZONS: THE SERIES Episode List
This is a website to easily access Pokémon Horizons episodes in Japanese, Subbed and Dubbed in English!
<br>This repository does not include every current episode, but is instead uploaded on an alternative site.
<br>Episodes were obtained from these links:
<br>- https://archive.org/details/PokemonHorizonsJP
<br>- https://archive.org/details/PokemonHorizonsEN_BBC
## Features
- Japanese episodes uploaded to YouTube (for approx. a week per episode)
- English Subbed episodes from a random website I found
- English Dubbed episodes from BBC iPlayer (currently, dunno about Netflix)
## How to Use
### Messaging Services
If you want to embed these episodes in messaging services, you can link this website (https://pokermmon.github.io) then afterwards, enter a slash, then specify if its jp, en_s, or en_d, then another slash and the episode number. Once sent, this will embed a video link to the video with the thumbnail (if both are available).
<br>***EXAMPLE:***
<br><a href="https://pokermmon.github.io/episodes"><img src="assets/horizonsembed.gif"></a>
### Website
If you go to the main website, you will see an episode list with the episode number, episode name (in JP/EN), and the JP, Subbed, and Dubbed versions will be linked below them.

### Website (Websim.ai)
This was created mostly using Claude Sonnet 3.5. It is the same premisis as the github.io site, but significantly better than the github site (plus it has a video player on the side!)
